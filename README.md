# Midwest Buffet

A collection of exercises to practice Ruby, and test-driven design (TDD).

## How to Run
Clone down repo

Create a class for each of the class tests in the `spec` directory.

Navigate to the `midwest-buffet` directory in your terminal, and then run your first test:

```
rspec spec/customer_spec.rb
```

Follow the errors that your test provides until the test passes. Unskip the next test by removing the `x`. Continue until all tests pass for each class.

## Suggested Order

* `buffet_dish_spec.rb`
* `buffet_side_spec.rb`
* `buffet_dessert_spec.rb`
* `buffet_spec.rb`
* `customer_spec.rb`
* `buffet_line_spec.rb`

## Add to the Buffet!

Can you add new classes to the repository? How about a BuffetManager?
If Customer.samples_food,  BufferManager.removes_customer...
